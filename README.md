# Integrate OCI Notifications with Microsoft Teams
Oracle Notification Service (ONS) is a robust cloud-native tool that allows you to route notifications from Oracle Topics to various destinations like email, Slack channels, custom HTTP webhooks or OCI Functions with ease.
Support of OCI Functions as Notification target allows to invoke cusotm function during Notification event and send updated notification details to communication channels that support API invocation.Â 
In this article, I'm going to show the integration between OCI and Microsoft Teams, ensuring that critical OCI events are communicated effectively to your team.

- **Resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** emit events, which are structured messages indicating the state of change of resources throughout the tenancy. For example, an event can be emitted when an instance starts, a backup completes or fails, or a file in an Object Storage bucket is added, updated, or deleted.
- **OCI Notifications** route these events to the appropriate destinations.
- **OCI Functions** reformat the event data (JSON Payload) to the Adaptive Card format required by Microsoft Teams.
- The restructured message is then published to Microsoft Teams via a webhook, ensuring that the notification is displayed correctly in the Teams channel.

## Pre-requisites:
1. **Create a Workflow in Microsoft Teams**: This allows posting to a channel or chat when a webhook request is received.
2. **Custom Functions Code**: Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo).
   
The following are the steps to get notified on MS Team when an instance is stopped.<br/>

## Step-by-Step Guide for Integrating OCI Notifications with Microsoft Teams

### Step 1: Create a Dynamic Group for Functions
To enable a function to access another Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) resource, include the function in a dynamic group and then create a policy to grant the dynamic group access to that resource.

Add the following dynamic group rule:

```plaintext
ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.oc1', instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.XXXXX'}
